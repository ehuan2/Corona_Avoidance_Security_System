# Corona_Avoidance_Security_System
The Corona Avoidance Security System or C.A.S.S. for short is a security system that lets users find a way around those infected.

Essentially, C.A.S.S. will let users flag areas that are infected, and then lets them find a path to their destination while avoiding those areas!

It applies many different areas of computer science, including graph theory and graphics in general.

For the graphics themselves, we are using a bit of an outdated system, but gets the job done. We are using the javax.swing module that lets us use both graphics and sets a nice GUI.

In terms of the path finding and avoidance software, it implements concepts found within Graph Theory, mainly using a form of Breadth First Search!
